## Project Objective

In all three of its locations, the Nigerian manufacturing company The Palmoria Group is dealing with problems related to gender imbalance. The headline "Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy" appeared in the headlines recently, which is regrettable. Given their desire to expand their company to other countries, this doesn't bode well for the business owners. Cases like this can only worsen, exposing additional problems like the gender pay gap among other potential problems. In other to get ahead of any suprises the HR Analyst was charged with identifying potential issues in the gender distribution across the company that can lead to damaging consequences.
### Objectives
-  What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to 
  regions and departments
- Show insights on ratings based on gender
  Analyse the company’s salary structure. 
  - Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the 
  department and regions that should be the focus of management
- A recent regulation was adopted which requires 
manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of 
$90,000
  - Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
- Show pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of 
   $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of 
   $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc. Also visualize this 
   by regions
- Calculate the amount to be paid as bonus to individual 
   employees
- Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees 
  (salary inclusive of bonus)
- Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
First step was to acquire the dataset from the HR team then to begin the data cleaning process I imported the dataset into PowerBI which is the choiced tool for this analysis. The process of importing the dataset is called GetData to get on with data cleaning I used PowerQuery as a transformation tool to clean the data. When I brought in the dataset, I had two tables to work with.
### In PowerQuery I took the following steps
- First step in power query was to rename the tables to reflect the information I was working with.
- I made sure each column has the right data type and changed the data types where data types didn't match for eachh column
- Promoted first rows as headers
- Filtered for blanks and removed null values 
- I checked for the validity of my data using the column distribution, quality, and profiling from the view tab. 
- Removed leading spaces to ensure there were no uneccessary white spaces
- Removed duplicate values
-  I added an index column to the tables where needed. To give the table a unique identifier column also a called primary key
- Replaced values where genders were not stated with a generic name "Unspecified"
- Removed values not useful for analysis based on an insider hint this include, employees without salary because they are no longer staff, 
  and department that indicated null.
- Created new Columns
- Executed unpivot to restructure a table within the dataset
- Renamed certain columns so that naming conventions are uniform across board.
- Due to the nature of the dataset provided in order to be able to perform some analysis we need our different tables to be able to communicate so, I merged     queries. The merge allows for communication between both tables.
- Created a new table called myMeasure to house measures to be created in my data model

## Data Modeling
For the data model, there wasn't a lot of tables to work with because I had merge both tables reflecting only the needed columns within the first table which I called Employee table. Due to that fact loading the second table called the bonus table into the data model will cause redundancy which was why it was excluded from the data model.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
Within the data report's fields pane, I created different measures using data analysis expressions (DAX) formulas. These measures will go on to become quite useful in my analysis. Measures allows us ask how data questions and derive answers, they are useful for the analysis of data.

### Measures Created
- Gender Classification Measures : To explore all the different gender classifications, Male , Female and Unspecified.

- Total Aggregation Measures : These measures were used to calculate the summation of the Bonus, Salary and Take-home columns.

- Minimum Employee Payout Requirement Measure: This measure was use to calculate the level of company compliance with the minimum pay requirement.

## Recommendations and Conclusions

-	The Management should set up structures to even out gender distribution across regions. 

- Departments with wide difference in gender distribution should be investigated to ascertain the reason and steps taken towards a more balanced distribution in those departments.

-	The gap in gender pay should be addressed especially where 	qualifications and duties are the same.

-	High rating employees should be properly acknowledged for their hard works. "Happy employees, makes a thriving organization",

-	The Management should take necessary steps required to meet the minimum employee pay threshold.
